# Project1

For this project I used HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and JQuery.

I used trello to keep track of my workflow, and mockflow to create a wireframe.

Given the choice between Connect 4 and Blackjack, I assumed Connect 4 would be pretty straight forward after doing Tic Tac Toe for homework. It was only after plotting everything out that I realized the differences that would make it more difficult.

Making a win was definitely the hardest part. I had to get help to figure that part out. I'm sure there is an easier more efficient way.

If I had more time and knowledge I would do the following:
1. Delay the prompts for player names. Whenever I tried, my board would stop accepting moves.
2. Play a sound whenever a move is made.
3. Have the game restart when done.
4. When a winner is declared, I would want it to output the name the player entered at the beginning.
5. I would also add opacity to the highlight column color of gold.
6. I would make this reponsive
